### Advent of Code 2024

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

These are my solutions for this year. Last year I only got to day 3 due to getting rather busy so I'm hoping to get a littlw further this year. I'm also going to use this as an opportunity to try the Rust programming language for the first time so we will see how that goes :)
